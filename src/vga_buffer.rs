//mutex stands for mutual exclusion, and it is a synchronization primitive that can be used to protect shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads. In this case, we are using a mutex to protect the WRITER instance, which is a shared resource that can be accessed by multiple threads. The lock() method is used to acquire the mutex, and the write_fmt() method is used to write the formatted arguments to the WRITER instance. The unwrap() method is used to handle any errors that may occur during the write operation.
